Changing the Glass Type

1. In the glass tab, under the section at the far left titled `Action`, we selected `Add` to add a new type of glass
2. In the next section over, titled `Apply Glass`, we selected `by Lite`, to change the glass type of specific lites.
3. Select the glass you would like to use in the menu. 
    -  You are able to filter results by using the `Description`, `Color`, `Type` fields, etcâ€¦ 
    - The `Show Label` Column allows you to customize the glass label shown on each lite in the drawing window. For the glass we selected, we changed the label to say `Tempered`.
4. Click on the lites/rows you would like to apply the new glass to.
