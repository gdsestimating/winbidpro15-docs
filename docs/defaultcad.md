You can manually set the program that opens DWG or DXF files on your PC. This is also called setting the "file association" in Windows. Most often this is done when you install a program that natively opens a specific file type, but in the case of DWG files, this would only be AutoCAD, by AutoDesk. Fortunately, Windows lets us change these associations manually.

### Step 4
You may only see the WinBidPro CAD program in the list, but if you have something like DraftSight or TurboCAD installed, you can pick one of those other programs.

### Step 5
Another way to get to one of these windows is to right-click on a DWG file and select Properties, then you can click the Change button like in the Windows 10 image above.

### Step 6
After setting the "file association" in Windows, the CAD link inside WinBidPro will open the drawing that is on the screen with the CAD program you selected. The same is true if you double-click on any DWG file in the File Explorer.
