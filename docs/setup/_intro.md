There are 3 common setups for WinBidPro:

1. [Single User Setup: Run it from your own computer with your own data files.](#single-user-setup)
2. [Multi-User Setup with Shared Data: Run it from your own computers, but share data with colleagues over a network.](#multi-user-setup-with-shared-data)
3. [Multi-User Remote Desktop Setup: Run it on a remote desktop server that users log into (Often managed by a third-party IT company)](/docs/setup/installing-on-a-server)

### Single User Setup

This is the simplest. Just [download the WinBidPro Installer from our downloads page](https://gdsestimating.com/downloads) and run the installer. There are no options or UI for the installer; it'll start the program once it's installed. You'll need a GDS Estimating account to sign into the license manager with. Once signed into WinBidPro, you'll automatically received a 30-day trial.

### Multi-User Setup with Shared Data

In this setup, users install the program on each of their own machines, but access their WinBidPro data from a shared network location. Install WinBidPro just the like in the Single User Setup described above, but then move your data to shared drive. Read [Sharing Catalogs](/docs/setup/sharing-catalogs) to learn more about how to do this.

### Multi-User Remote Desktop Setup

In this setup, users all log into a remote or locally networked server such as Windows Server or Citrix. This is an advanced setup that usually requires an IT professional. Read [Installing on a Server](/docs/setup/installing-on-a-server) to learn how to best deploy WinBidPro in a Remote Desktop setup with many users.
