## Sorting the Cut and Stock Lists

### Sorting by Column
The cut list can be sorted by any column in ascending ​or descending order​.

 
To do this, click the column you want to sort by. The cut list will be sorted in ascending or descending order indicated by the black arrow above the column name.
​

You can also sort by multiple columns by Shift+Clicking additional columns

### Sorting with Filters
You can also sort the cut list by filtering any column based on a criteria.

​
For example, you can show all cuts with part numbers containing the letters "AS"

### Grouping by Column
Another new feature of the Optimizer is the ability to group cuts by column for a more simplified view of the cut list.
​

For example you can group by Elevation by dragging that column to the section above.

### Modifying a Cut
You can modify a cut by either changing its quantity, its cut length, or its elevation code. In this example we change the quantity of a cut.

​
To do this, click the field you would like to modify, type in a new value then hit the Enter key.

 
Modified cuts will be bolded in the cut list, and will be classified as `Modified` under the `State` column.
